Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by russianI, I have begun a "fixer' for foreign journalists and at the same time I've written some optimistic news for Ukrainians. I will attach some of them below.

### Train 700+ people every week. As the founder of FAST, Fedir Serdyuk trains the First Aid Defense Forces

He began training the military at the beginning of the Russian-Ukrainian war. He later turned his own knowledge into a successful business. FAST became the leader of the Ukrainian market and conducted trainings for the largest companies in the country. And Fedor himself entered the Ukrainian and European lists of Forbes "30 under 30".

But it was all before the full-scale invasion. Today, part of the FAST team is defending Ukraine in the Armed Forces, and business founder Fedir Serdyuk is once again training for the Defense Forces. Its people train at least 700 defenders every week, who can save not only health but also lives.

### 1200+ animals were evacuated. How Kharkiv activists rescue four-legged animals from shelling

They stayed in Kharkiv because they understood that in the event of a full-scale invasion, the animals would need help. This is the story of the public organization "Animal Rescue Kharkiv", whose team has saved more than 1,000 animals from the shelling.

Activists travel to the hottest areas of the region, in fact to the forefront, and risk their own lives to save the four-legged animals and find them a new home. And although in the second week of the war a Russian shell hit the Adoption Center, they do not stop and continue to help animals that find themselves in abandoned apartments and under the rubble.

### "You have to do, not talk." Leonid Ostaltsev, founder of the Veterano group, talks about starting with \$50, the value of business, and the readiness to fight back against invaders

He returned from the war and began to help his fellows adapt to life after the front. And when he heard that they refused to hire them, he decided in a few minutes to sketch out a business plan for a future pizzeria. Thus came the Veterano brand - probably the most famous business of Ukrainian defenders. About the values and role of money, personal beliefs, incorrigible optimism and willingness to fight back the Russian occupiers, Leonid Ostaltsev told ShoTam.
