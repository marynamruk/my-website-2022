### Train 700+ people every week. As the founder of FAST, Fedir Serdyuk trains the First Aid Defense Forces

He began training the military at the beginning of the Russian-Ukrainian war. He later turned his own knowledge into a successful business. FAST became the leader of the Ukrainian market and conducted trainings for the largest companies in the country. And Fedor himself entered the Ukrainian and European lists of Forbes "30 under 30".

But it was all before the full-scale invasion. Today, part of the FAST team is defending Ukraine in the Armed Forces, and business founder Fedir Serdyuk is once again training for the Defense Forces. Its people train at least 700 defenders every week, who can save not only health but also lives.

### 1200+ animals were evacuated. How Kharkiv activists rescue four-legged animals from shelling

They stayed in Kharkiv because they understood that in the event of a full-scale invasion, the animals would need help. This is the story of the public organization "Animal Rescue Kharkiv", whose team has saved more than 1,000 animals from the shelling.

Activists travel to the hottest areas of the region, in fact to the forefront, and risk their own lives to save the four-legged animals and find them a new home. And although in the second week of the war a Russian shell hit the Adoption Center, they do not stop and continue to help animals that find themselves in abandoned apartments and under the rubble.
